PCB files for RPI Expansion Board

# Description

This is the expansion board for the mainboard.

- Part 2

A small info display is activated via an MCU and the temperature is read from the mainboard. There is also a mic, light sensor and the rotary switch for switching the streamer on and off (and restarting it), as well as status LEDs. 

The RGB is controlled via the MCU. In addition, the MCU can be reset or booted via separate buttons

The board can be produced here (AISLER) with the files (.brd and .sch) or by any other PCB manufacturer. -> https://aisler.net/
